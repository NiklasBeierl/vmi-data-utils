# About

This is a collection of tools and information surrounding the collection of memory snapshots and debugging symbols for purposes such as machine learning based memory forensics. 
See my other project: [NoSyms](https://github.com/NiklasBeierl/nosyms) for an example.

**NOTE**: The information and tools here are focused on investigating _Linux_ memory snapshots.

As usual, All information and tools here come with **no warranty** of any kind, I am always happy to consider PRs with new tools or updates.
